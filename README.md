# Advanced Machine Learning 

This repository consists of personal projects covering a range of topics in advanced machine learning. 

The projects include: 
1. Deep Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
5. Ensemble methods

Below are details of the respective projects. 

## 1. Deep Nueral Networks 
Use encoders and decoders to remove noise from images. 

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Utilize transfer learning from mobilenet to classify if there are people in dataset. 

## 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Build an RNN from scratch to predict temperature. Feature engineering was performed to improve performance. 

## 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Create model to classify whether an image is real or fake. Resnet and Word2Vec was used in base model. 

## 5. Ensemble Models
Utilize ensemble models to predict the number of vehicles and signals in an image.
